# Hipermedia

**User profile:**

The user receiving this project would be the one interested in hiring an employee specialized in video game development (especially a programmer).

**Information architecture:**

First I put the image in the middle of the two bars so that it stood out, and below it I put the basic information of the person and their contact information: email, phone number, address, date of birth and nationality. Below this I put the languages ​​they spoke, which were: Spanish, with a native level; Catalan, native as well as Spanish and English with an advanced level but not expert at the same time. After putting the basic information I put the name in big letters in the horizontal bar above and began to put the rest of the information that was left. I put the subtitles in bold: summary, education and skills, and then the adjacent information for each one. The summary being a small explanation of what the person works or specializes in and what knowledge they have. In education I put information about where they have enrolled and what. And finally the skills, putting a small list indicating them one by one.

**Visual design:**

After looking at different examples I have decided to do it the following way. First of all I put a dark red border (#8A0000) around the page. Then I would put a big horizontal blue bar (#002092) where the person's name will go in large letters. A vertical bar would follow, placed on top of the previous one, this time in light blue (#88a3ff) where the basic information will be. Now I would make a navy blue square (#4462c9) at the point where the two bars meet to give the visual effect that it is transparent. Finally I would put a thin black vertical bar on top of the other vertical bar. And after that I will have a big white space in the middle/down-right for the rest of the information.
